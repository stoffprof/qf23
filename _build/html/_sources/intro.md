```{epigraph}
The two greatest inventions of the human mind are writing and money---the common language of intelligence, and the common language of self-interest.

```{epigraph}
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.

# Introduction

This book project is currently under development. We will be using it in F-455 Quant Finance in Spring, 2023.

## Coding conventions

Even if a particular chapter doesn't have `import` statements, it is safe to assume that the following modules have been imported before executing any code.

```python
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader as pdr
import scipy.stats as scs

from numpy.random import default_rng
rng = default_rng(8675309)
```

## Greek letters in code

We often use Greek letters to denote variables or parameters in economics and finance. Throughout this book I'll use these letters in code, like this:

```python
Œº = 0
œÉ = 1
```

I find this cleaner and easier to follow than the older coding convention, which was to write

```python
mu = 0
sigma = 1
```

To use Greek letters in your own code, you can copy them from the [Character viewer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-emoji-and-symbols-on-mac-mchlp1560/mac) on a Mac, or [Insert symbol](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/insert-ascii-or-unicode-latin-based-symbols-and-characters-d13f58d3-7bcb-44a7-a4d5-972ee12e50e0) on Windows. A Google search will turn up many options for making this process easier for whichever operating system you're using. Just be careful to be consistent when entering these letters, as there are different versions of the same thing: Œ≤ and ùõΩ are two different symbols for beta, and using them both in code would create two different variables.

The Greek letters we use are:

Character | Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Character | Name
|---|---|---|---|
Œ±|alpha    |Œº|mu      
Œ≤|beta     |œÄ|pi      
Œ≥, Œì|gamma |œÅ|rho     
Œ¥, Œî|delta |œÉ, Œ£|sigma
Œµ|epsilon  |œÑ|tau     
Œ∑|eta      |œÜ|phi     
Œ∏|theta    |œâ, Œ©|omega
Œª|lambda   |ŒΩ|nu
